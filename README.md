CNC buffer cape for BeagleBone Black

This cape isolates I/O signals on the BBB from voltage spikes and surges. It also features a LVDS video serializer compatible with most flatscreen LCDs.

Features:

    15 high-speed outputs
    4 solid state relay outputs (500mA)
    10 high-speed inputs
    12 bit color LVDS video (CMOS)
    isolated serial port I/O (UART4)


All the optos are DIP socketed. There is a slot for easy access to serial debug. And there's an LED.   ;-)

This version is tested and working. 


The outputs are divided into five sections. Each section is powered through seperate V and GND nets. 

The input voltage range is 3-6 volts.
